Summary
I have successfully implemented the "Borrow as a Party" feature for the board game ordering system. Here's what was added:
✅ Changes Made:
1. HTML Changes (index.html)
Added a hidden party dropdown wrapper inside the order form:
Apply to log.txt
2. JavaScript Changes (main.js)
Import: Added getUserProfile to the imports from ./js/modules/api.js
Global Variable: Added let games = [] to store fetched games
New Function: populatePartyDropdown() - Fetches user profile and populates party dropdown
Updated Function: bindOrderButtons() - Now async and calls populatePartyDropdown() for logged-in users
Updated Function: renderGames() - Now stores fetched games in the global games variable
Updated Form Submission: Added logic to include party_id in the payload if a party is selected
✅ Key Features Implemented:
Dynamic Party Loading: When a logged-in user opens the order modal, the system automatically fetches their profile and populates the party dropdown with their available parties.
Conditional Display: The party dropdown only shows for logged-in users who have parties. Anonymous users and users without parties won't see the dropdown.
Backward Compatibility: The feature is completely optional - if no party is selected, the order works exactly as before (individual borrowing).
Error Handling: If there's an error loading parties, the dropdown is hidden gracefully without breaking the order flow.
Form Integration: The selected party_id is automatically included in the order payload sent to the backend.
✅ Backend Integration:
The implementation follows the backend assumptions:
POST /order-game accepts party_id as an optional field
If provided, the backend will create a party session linked to the game and selected party
If omitted, it works like before (individual borrowing)
The endpoint supports both logged-in users and anonymous guests
✅ User Experience:
Logged-in users with parties: See a dropdown to optionally select a party
Logged-in users without parties: Don't see the dropdown (clean interface)
Anonymous users: Don't see the dropdown (no change to existing behavior)
Form submission: Includes party_id only when a party is selected
The implementation is complete, follows all the specified requirements, and maintains backward compatibility with existing functionality.
