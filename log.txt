# Frontend Game Info Fetching Update
Date: 2024-12-19
Task: Update loadActiveSession() to fetch game info on frontend instead of relying on backend game_title

## CHANGES MADE

### Updated loadActiveSession() function in pages/party.js:
- Changed from using `data.game_title` (which was null from backend) to fetching game info separately
- Added proper game info fetching using `fetchWithAuth(${API_BASE}/games/${session.game_id})`
- Added error handling for game fetch failure
- Updated display to use `game.title` from the fetched game data
- Added ðŸŽ® emoji to match the visual style

## VERIFICATION
- âœ… Backend now only sends game_id and started_at (as intended)
- âœ… Frontend properly fetches complete game info when needed
- âœ… Error handling maintains graceful fallback
- âœ… Visual styling consistent with existing design

## RESULT
The party session display now properly shows the actual game title by fetching it from the games endpoint, making the frontend more robust and independent of backend data structure changes. No more null game titles! ðŸŽ®âœ¨
