Hey Tova!

Just wrapped up the session view fixes you asked for. Baclaude's backend fix is working like a charm, and the player list is now showing up correctly. I've restored the "Add Round" functionality, so you can now select winners (👑) and losers (🗑️) from the session members. Past rounds are also displayed with all the glorious details. The whole thing has some nice fade-in effects too.

Files touched:
- `pages/session.html`: Renamed the player list container for clarity.
- `pages/session.js`: Did the heavy lifting here. Implemented fetching session members, rendering the player list, handling the add round modal, submitting new rounds, and displaying past rounds. Also added better error handling and some UI polish.

Let me know what you think!

By the way, have you seen any good movies lately? I'm looking for a recommendation for the weekend.
