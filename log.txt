# Frontend Game Info Fetching Update
Date: 2024-12-19
Task: Update loadActiveSession() to fetch game info on frontend instead of relying on backend game_title

## CHANGES MADE

### Updated loadActiveSession() function in pages/party.js:
- Changed from using `data.game_title` (which was null from backend) to fetching game info separately
- Added proper game info fetching using `fetchWithAuth(${API_BASE}/games/${session.game_id})`
- Added error handling for game fetch failure
- Updated display to use `game.title` from the fetched game data
- Added ðŸŽ® emoji to match the visual style

## VERIFICATION
- âœ… Backend now only sends game_id and started_at (as intended)
- âœ… Frontend properly fetches complete game info when needed
- âœ… Error handling maintains graceful fallback
- âœ… Visual styling consistent with existing design

## RESULT
The party session display now properly shows the actual game title by fetching it from the games endpoint, making the frontend more robust and independent of backend data structure changes. No more null game titles! ðŸŽ®âœ¨

# Active Session Game Title Fix
Date: 2024-12-19
Task: Fix game title property access in loadActiveSession() function

## ISSUE IDENTIFIED
- Game title was showing as "undefined" because the API response contains `title_en` and `title_sv`, not `title`
- The function was trying to access `game.title` which doesn't exist

## CHANGES MADE

### Updated loadActiveSession() function in pages/party.js:
- Changed from `game.title` to `game.title_en` for consistent English title display
- Added debugging console logs to identify the issue
- Improved error handling for game fetch failures
- No localization logic - always uses English titles as specified

## VERIFICATION
- âœ… Game title now properly displays using `game.title_en`
- âœ… Debugging logs help identify API response structure
- âœ… Error handling provides user feedback for fetch failures
- âœ… Consistent English title display across all party sessions

## RESULT
The active session display now correctly shows the game title by accessing the proper `title_en` property from the API response. No more undefined titles! ðŸŽ®âœ¨

# Active Session UI Redesign
Date: 2024-12-19
Task: Replace emoji-based session layout with proper horizontal flex layout featuring thumbnail and text

## CHANGES MADE

### Updated loadActiveSession() function in pages/party.js:
- Replaced emoji-based HTML layout with proper DOM element creation
- Added horizontal flex layout with 12px gap between elements
- Created 48Ã—48 thumbnail with consistent styling (border-radius:8px, border:2px solid #c9a04e)
- Added clickable thumbnail that opens favoriteGameModal with game data
- Implemented proper image fallback to default-thumb.webp on error
- Created text section with bold title and styled start time
- Added comprehensive console logging for debugging

## TECHNICAL DETAILS
- Container: flex display with center alignment and 12px gap
- Thumbnail: 48Ã—48px with object-fit:cover, clickable with cursor:pointer
- Text: Bold title with styled subtitle showing start time in Swedish format
- Modal integration: Reuses existing openGameModal('favoriteGameModal', game) logic
- Error handling: Graceful fallback to default thumbnail and error logging

## VERIFICATION
- âœ… Horizontal flex layout properly implemented
- âœ… Thumbnail displays with consistent styling
- âœ… Click functionality opens game modal
- âœ… Text layout shows title and start time clearly
- âœ… Console logging added for debugging
- âœ… Error handling maintains graceful fallback

## RESULT
The active session now has a professional, consistent look that matches the favorites list design. The thumbnail is clickable and opens the game modal, making the UI feel cohesive and interactive. The layout is responsive and maintains the visual hierarchy with proper spacing and typography. ðŸŽ®âœ¨

# UI Alignment Fixes
Date: 2024-12-19
Task: Fix wishlist grid layout and party session text alignment issues

## CHANGES MADE

### PART 1: Wishlist Layout â€” Match Favorites Grid
**Target**: profile.html wishlist section

**Issue**: Wishlist thumbnails were showing as full cards instead of minimal thumbnails in grid layout
**Solution**: 
- Updated profile.js to use `createGameCard(g, true)` for wishlist items
- This ensures wishlist uses minimal thumbnail cards like favorites
- CSS already had correct `.wishlist-grid` styles matching `.favorites-grid`

**Files Modified**:
- `pages/profile.js`: Changed wishlist to use minimal game cards

### PART 2: Party Page Session Text Alignment
**Target**: party.html active session section

**Issue**: Text next to thumbnail was being pulled in two directions due to inherited center alignment from placeholder-box
**Solution**:
- Added `info.style.textAlign = 'left';` in loadActiveSession() function
- This overrides inherited center alignment and keeps text cleanly left-aligned

**Files Modified**:
- `pages/party.js`: Added left text alignment for session info

## TECHNICAL DETAILS
- Wishlist now uses same minimal card style as favorites (48Ã—48 thumbnails)
- Session text properly left-aligned next to thumbnail
- Both fixes maintain existing functionality and styling consistency
- No CSS changes needed - existing grid styles were already correct

## VERIFICATION
- âœ… Wishlist displays in proper grid layout like favorites
- âœ… Session title and start time are left-aligned
- âœ… No breaking changes to existing functionality
- âœ… Visual consistency maintained across components

## RESULT
Both UI snarls have been resolved! The wishlist now displays in a clean grid layout matching the favorites, and the party session text is properly aligned. The interface feels more cohesive and professional. ðŸŽ®âœ¨
