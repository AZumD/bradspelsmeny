Summary
I have successfully implemented the "Borrow as a Party" feature for the board game ordering system. Here's what was added:
âœ… Changes Made:
1. HTML Changes (index.html)
Added a hidden party dropdown wrapper inside the order form:
Apply to log.txt
2. JavaScript Changes (main.js)
Import: Added getUserProfile to the imports from ./js/modules/api.js
Global Variable: Added let games = [] to store fetched games
New Function: populatePartyDropdown() - Fetches user profile and populates party dropdown
Updated Function: bindOrderButtons() - Now async and calls populatePartyDropdown() for logged-in users
Updated Function: renderGames() - Now stores fetched games in the global games variable
Updated Form Submission: Added logic to include party_id in the payload if a party is selected
âœ… Key Features Implemented:
Dynamic Party Loading: When a logged-in user opens the order modal, the system automatically fetches their profile and populates the party dropdown with their available parties.
Conditional Display: The party dropdown only shows for logged-in users who have parties. Anonymous users and users without parties won't see the dropdown.
Backward Compatibility: The feature is completely optional - if no party is selected, the order works exactly as before (individual borrowing).
Error Handling: If there's an error loading parties, the dropdown is hidden gracefully without breaking the order flow.
Form Integration: The selected party_id is automatically included in the order payload sent to the backend.
âœ… Backend Integration:
The implementation follows the backend assumptions:
POST /order-game accepts party_id as an optional field
If provided, the backend will create a party session linked to the game and selected party
If omitted, it works like before (individual borrowing)
The endpoint supports both logged-in users and anonymous guests
âœ… User Experience:
Logged-in users with parties: See a dropdown to optionally select a party
Logged-in users without parties: Don't see the dropdown (clean interface)
Anonymous users: Don't see the dropdown (no change to existing behavior)
Form submission: Includes party_id only when a party is selected
The implementation is complete, follows all the specified requirements, and maintains backward compatibility with existing functionality.

Summary of Fixes Applied:
Commit: 13ce271 - "fix: improve party dropdown functionality"
ðŸ”§ Key Issues Fixed:
Event Listener Duplication:
Fixed the bindOrderButtons() function to prevent multiple event listeners on the same buttons
Used replaceWith(button.cloneNode(true)) to remove existing listeners before adding new ones
Enhanced Debugging:
Added comprehensive console logging to populatePartyDropdown() function
Logs user data status, API calls, party data, and visibility changes
Helps identify exactly where the process might be failing
Improved Error Handling:
Added null checks for DOM elements (partySelectWrapper and partySelect)
Ensures the function doesn't crash if elements aren't found
Better error handling for API failures
Proper State Management:
Explicitly hide party dropdown for non-logged-in users
Clear separation between logged-in and guest user flows
ðŸ§ª Testing Ready:
The implementation now includes extensive debugging that will help identify any remaining issues:
Console logs will show when populatePartyDropdown() is called
API response logging will show what data is returned from getUserProfile()
Party data logging will show if parties are found and populated
Visibility logging will confirm when the dropdown is shown/hidden
ðŸŽ¯ Expected Behavior:
Logged-in users with parties: Should see the party dropdown populated with their parties
Logged-in users without parties: Should not see the party dropdown
Anonymous/guest users: Should not see the party dropdown
Form submission: Should include party_id only when a party is selected
The debugging logs will help identify exactly where the process might be failing if the dropdown still doesn't appear. 
You can now test the implementation and check the browser console for detailed information about what's happening during the party dropdown population process.
