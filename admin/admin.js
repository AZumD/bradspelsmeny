// admin.js (cleaned)

// This script is now minimal and only responsible for initializing dashboard stats or lightweight UI
// logic on the admin landing page. All edit functionality has been moved to edit-games.js.

// If you need to add dashboard functionality like usage stats, chart rendering, or tile updates,
// this is the place to do it.
